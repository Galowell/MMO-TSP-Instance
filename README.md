# MMO-TSP-Instance
This is dataset repository for multimodal TSP (travel salesman problem) including TSPLIB and self-created instances mentioned in GECCO 2018 paper "Multimodal Optimization of Traveling Salesman Problem: A Niching Ant Colony System".
Oliver30,chn31,rand50,ulysses16 and ulysses22 are instances in TSPLIB. We build self10-1,self8-1,self10-2 and self8-2 instances to test algorithms. Each of them has two optimal solutions where distances between them are far and length are close. Test16 is mentioned in S.Ronald [1995] "Finding multiple solutions with an evolutionary algorithm"
